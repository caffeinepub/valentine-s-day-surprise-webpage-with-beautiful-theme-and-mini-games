  "summary": "The diff adds a new full-screen first-entry prompt component and gates rendering of the existing Valentine flow behind it. However, the implemented “No” button behavior appears to move both vertically and horizontally, while the requirement specifies vertical (up/down) movement.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "The “No” option should move/jumble vertically (up/down) within the prompt area to avoid being selected.",
      "reason": "The implementation randomizes both `top` and `left` for the “No” button, indicating horizontal movement in addition to vertical movement, which does not match the specified vertical-only behavior.",
