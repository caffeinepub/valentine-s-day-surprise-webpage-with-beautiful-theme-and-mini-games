  "summary": "ClosingSection was updated to show a teddy image with a custom jump animation and added Yes/No choice UI, plus new CSS keyframes/utilities. However, the teddy image asset itself is not present in the diff, the required exact “Yes” confirmation text is not displayed exactly, and reduced-motion handling for the teddy animation is not evidenced in the provided diff excerpts.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "The teddy has a continuous jump/bounce animation and respects prefers-reduced-motion by reducing/disabling the animation.",
      "reason": "A looping animation class/keyframes are added, but no prefers-reduced-motion handling is shown in the provided CSS diff excerpt.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Clicking “Yes” displays exactly: \"I love you, wife garu\".",
      "reason": "The Yes message includes extra characters (a heart emoji) and therefore is not exactly the specified string.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Add the generated teddy image asset under frontend/public/assets/generated and reference it via /assets/generated/... path.",
      "reason": "The code references /assets/generated/valentine-teddy.dim_512x512.png, but the diff shows no added static asset file (and no frontend/public/... changes), so the required image file addition is not implemented in the diff.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added extra copy and UI beyond the requested Yes/No outcome: a longer thank-you paragraph after “Yes”, and a “Try Again” button after “No”.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 only asks to display the confirmation message for “Yes” and a playful prompt for “No”; it does not request additional paragraphs or an extra reset button.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added emoji characters in the displayed messages (e.g., heart emoji on Yes message; smiling emoji on No prompt).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest specifies exact text for the Yes message and describes the No prompt in English; emojis were not requested and in the Yes case break the exact-text requirement.",
